================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-675: Duplicate Operations on Resource
Issue: This provided code lacks any controlling mechanisms that ensure unique operations upon a resource. The `apply` method repeats operations on subprojects without verifying that they haven't been applied previously. This can lead to unanticipated results, possibly affecting system performance or stability.
Solution: Introduce control mechanisms to detect and avoid duplicate operations. For instance, mark projects that have already been processed and skip re-processing in the `apply` method.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The `apply` method is public, allowing access from outside the class. While not directly dangerous, it could permit function calls in contexts that may not have been clearly intended, potentially leading to vulnerabilities especially if it modifies vital project properties.
Solution: Consider scoping the `apply` method appropriately. If it's not necessary for it to have public access, changing it to private or protected would improve security.

Vulnerability: CWE-440: Expected Behavior Violation
Issue: The `apply` method assumes that all subprojects need to have documentation skipped if the main project has `SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY`. This expectation might not always hold true, causing unintended behavior.
Solution: Provide a mechanism to toggle `SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY` for individual subprojects instead of applying it universally. This provides more granular control and aligns with principle of least privilege.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing the application of the "skipDocumentationTasks" method to a target project that has the "SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY" 

Details:  
  TestName: testApplyMethodWhenProjectHasSkipDocsProperty
  Description: This test is meant to check the 'apply' method functionality when the target project has the SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY. It will validate if the 'skipDocumentationTasks' function is correctly applied to the target project and all its subprojects. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock 'Project' which has the SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY, and some subprojects.
  Act: Invoke the 'apply' method with the mock 'Project'.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'skipDocumentationTasks' method is called for the project and all of its subprojects.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the 'apply' method correctly applies the 'skipDocumentationTasks' to a project with the SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY and all its subprojects. This is important for ensuring that the application's documentation skipping feature works correctly.

Scenario 2: Testing the "apply" method when the target project doesn't have the "SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY"

Details:  
  TestName: testApplyMethodWhenProjectDoesNotHaveSkipDocsProperty
  Description: This test is meant to verify the behavior of the 'apply' method when the target project does not contain the SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY. In this case, the 'skipDocumentationTasks' should not be invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 'Project' mock object that doesn't have the SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY.
  Act: Call the 'apply' method with the mock 'Project'.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the 'skipDocumentationTasks' method is never called.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to check that the 'skipDocumentationTasks' function is not applied to a project and its subprojects if they do not contain the SKIP_DOCS_PROPERTY. This is crucial as it ensures that documentation is not skipped for projects that are not intended to skip it.

Scenario 3: Testing the "apply" method with a null target project

Details:  
  TestName: testApplyMethodWithNullProject
  Description: This test is supposed to verify the behavior of the 'apply' method when provided with a null project. This scenario might occur due to an error in the application, and it's important to ensure that the function handles it correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not necessary as we are testing with a null project.
  Act: Call the 'apply' method with a null.
  Assert: Use JUnit to confirm that a certain type of exception (like a NullPointerException) is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the program correctly addresses the scenario when the 'apply' method is called with a null project. Proper error handling is essential in maintaining the stability and error-tolerance level of the application.
