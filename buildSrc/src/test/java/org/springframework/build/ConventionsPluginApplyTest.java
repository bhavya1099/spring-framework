================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The code does not check the integrity of libraries it downloads from other sources. This could lead to the execution of potentially malicious code.
Solution: To mitigate this vulnerability, add a checksum validation step when downloading a library. If the checksums don't match, the download could have been tampered with and should be rejected.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: Project objects are directly exposed to method calls without any validation. External input could reach sensitive methods.
Solution: Implement an Access Control List, or a similar mechanism, for controlling what external input can be passed to sensitive methods within your Project objects.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Methods or Functions
Issue: The methods ‘CheckstyleConventions().apply’, ‘JavaConventions().apply’, ‘KotlinConventions().apply’, and ‘TestConventions().apply’ are public, allowing for potential malicious use if not adequately secured.
Solution: Ensure these exposed methods are secure by executing robust input validation and safeguarding against potential risk scenarios, such as injection attacks or any other misuse of these methods.

"""
Scenario 1: Basic successful execution of 'apply' method

Details:  
    TestName: testApplyMethodExecution.
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the 'apply' method successfully calls the 'apply' method of each convention.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a ‘Project' object.
    Act: Invoke the 'apply' method with the 'Project' mock as parameter.
    Assert: Verify using Mockito that 'apply' was called on each mock convention (CheckstyleConventions, JavaConventions, KotlinConventions, TestConventions).
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the 'apply' method successfully calls the 'apply' method of each convention class. It is crucial to ensure that all conventions are applied correctly to maintain the framework's behavior.

Scenario 2: Exception handling when invoking 'apply' methods of conventions

Details:  
    TestName: testExceptionHandlingOnApplyMethods.
    Description: This test is constructed to test whether the 'apply' method can correctly handle the exceptions thrown by the 'apply' methods of each convention.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a ‘Project' object and modify each convention's 'apply' method to throw an exception when invoked.
    Act: Invoke the 'apply' method with the 'Project' mock as parameter.
    Assert: Assert that no exception was thrown from the 'apply' method in the main class.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the 'apply' method in the main class can handle exceptions from convention methods, ensuring the 'apply' method's execution is not affected by potential exceptional behavior in convention methods.

Scenario 3: Check if 'apply' method can be executed on a null project

Details:  
    TestName: testApplyMethodWithNullProject.
    Description: This test checks if the 'apply' method throws NullpointerException when invoked with a null 'Project' object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the 'Project' object as null.
    Act: Invoke the 'apply' method with the null 'Project' object.
    Assert: Assert that a NullpointerException was thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test is significant to ensure that the 'apply' method behaves expectedly when invoked with null parameters, and throws an exception instead of halting or causing unpredictable behaviors.

Scenario 4: Check if 'apply' method behaves correctly when conventions' apply methods return unintended results

Details:  
    TestName: testApplyMethodWithInvalidConventionResults.
    Description: This test is meant to verify the behavior of 'apply' method when the 'apply' methods of conventions do not function as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a 'Project' object and alter the 'apply' methods of conventions to return unintended results.
    Act: Invoke the 'apply' method with the 'Project' mock as parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the 'apply' method behaves in a way that's predictable and aligns with business requirements even when convention methods malfunction.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to validate the integrity of the 'apply' method in irregular circumstances. It's a crucial part in maintaining the robustness of the framework.
