================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Java I/O Capabilities CWE-749
Issue: The Java application code does not handle user-supplied files safely, which may open the door to various file-related security issues such as path traversal and malicious file execution.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input paths to ensure they don't contain characters or sequences that could be used for path traversal or other malicious activities. If possible, confine file operations to a specific directory and prevent any actions outside of this intended scope.

Vulnerability: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Classpath
Issue: Classpaths in Java often include sensitive information such as names, locations, and details of classes used in a particular project. An attacker may leverage this information to better understand the structure of your application and formulates targeted attacks.
Solution: Ensure that such sensitive information is not unnecessarily included within the classpath; use obfuscation if needed and limit visibility.

Vulnerability: Unmanaged Resources
Issue: This code makes actions on file systems, yet it doesn't seem to implement any procedure for resource management. Poorly managed resources may result in memory leaks, system slowdowns, or hung processes.
Solution: Implement try-with-resources or finally blocks to ensure that resources are properly released after usage.

Vulnerability: Hard-Coded Configuration
Issue: Hard-coded configurations can lead to a variety of security issues, depending on the exact nature of the configuration.
Solution: Refactor code to retrieve configurations from a secure location, such as environment variables or secure key storage.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Positive TestCase to Validate pattern

Details:  
    TestName: testGetPatternValidCase.
    Description: This Test is meant to check if the getPattern() function is returning the correct pattern.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the pattern with some value.
    Act: Invoke getPattern() method.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the expected pattern with the returned pattern by getPattern() method.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getPattern() method returns the correct pattern. The expected result is pre-set during the test initialization. This test is significant to ensure that getPattern works as expected with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Negative TestCase to Validate Null pattern 

Details:  
    TestName: testGetPatternNullCase.
    Description: This Test is meant to check if the getPattern() behaves as expected when the pattern is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not initialize a pattern or set it to null.
    Act: Invoke getPattern() method.
    Assert: Use assertNull to check that the getPattern() method returns null. 
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that getPattern() method returns null when the pattern has not been initialized. This is significant to ensure that your code behaves correctly in the absence of input values.

Scenario 3: Edge Case Test to Validate Empty pattern 

Details:  
    TestName: testGetPatternEmptyCase.
    Description: This Test is meant to check if getPattern() behaves as expected when the pattern is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the pattern to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke getPattern() method.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to compare that the returned pattern by getPattern() is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that getPattern() method returns an empty string when the pattern has been initialized to an empty string. This is significant to ensure that your code correctly handles edge cases.
